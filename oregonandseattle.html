	<h2>Smith Rock State Park</h2>
	<p>Location: The park is just outside the town of Terrebonne, in Central Oregon's High Desert near Bend. </p>
	<p>With dramatic cliffs, towering red rocks, a meandering river and views for days, Smith Rock State Park is spectacular in every season.
		As one of the natural wonders of Oregon, this pristine area in the centre of the state is well worth the trip, whether it’s for a quick stop to look out from one of the great viewpoints near the park’s entrance or to properly explore by heading down into the canyon.</p>

	<h2>Cannon Beach</h2>
	<p>Location: Cannon Beach is a city in Clatsop County, Oregon. </p>
	<p>The Pacific Ocean and the Coast Mountain Range cradles Cannon Beach, one of Oregon’s coastal cities known for its forested bluffs, towering monoliths and miles of pristine, sandy beaches, the latter earning it accolades as one of “Americas Best Beaches.” The dramatic Cannon Beach coastline offers an inspiring mélange of nature: sand, ocean, mountains, rock, and birds, all of which bring tourists flocking to this popular beach town, 90 minutes west of Portland. Cannon Beach is a small coastal city in northwest Oregon. It’s known for its long, sandy shore. Standing tall in the ocean, Haystack Rock is a seasonal haven for tufted puffins. On a headland to the north, trails in Ecola State Park offer sweeping views of the ocean, coves and a lighthouse. South is Arcadia Beach, with tide pools and a picnic area. Nearby Hug Point has sea caves. Boutiques and galleries dot downtown.</p>
